# Finance Trend Forecasting Prediction for Real Stocks Model Comparison

## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive comparison of various machine learning and statistical models for predicting stock prices. The project focuses on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data from 2022 to 2023 and evaluates the performance of Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM models.

## Project Overview
- **Data Source**: Historical stock data for AAPL from January 2022 to December 2023.
- **Models Compared**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- **Performance Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `yfinance`, `statsmodels`

## Results and Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to compare the performance of different models.

- **Model Performance Comparison**: A graph comparing the RMSE values of Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM models.
- **Actual vs Predicted Values**: Graphs showing the actual stock prices versus the predicted values for each model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how different models can be used to forecast stock prices and highlights their strengths and weaknesses. It serves as a starting point for further research and development in the field of financial forecasting.
